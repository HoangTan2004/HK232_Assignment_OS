## Overview

**Name:** Simple Operating System

**Semester:** 232

**Goal:** The objective of this assignment is the simulation of major components in a simple operating system, for example, scheduler, synchronization, related operations of physical memory and virtual memory.

**Content:** In detail, student will practice with three major modules: scheduler, synchronization, mechanism of memory allocation from virtual-to-physical memory.
- scheduler
- synchronization
- the operations of mem-allocation from virtual-to-physical

**Result:** After this assignment, student can understand partly the principle of a simple OS. They can understand and draw the role of OS key modules.
